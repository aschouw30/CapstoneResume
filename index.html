    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>I am a motivated graduate from Cape Peninsula University of Technology, with a Diploma in Software Development.
        I am hardworking, dedicated and keen to learn new things even if it pushes me out of my comfort zone. I believe
        that the only way you can learn and grow is by doing things you have never done before and failing.
        I accept challenges with open arms as that is how I grow and become a better developer, not only expanding my knowledge
        but my skillset. </p>
